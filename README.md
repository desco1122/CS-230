# Gaming Room Journal

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room was a mobile app game creator with experienced success launching a puzzle competition game on the Android platform. The client wanted to develop a web-based version of its current Android app to make the game available across multiple platforms and devices.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I wrote a comprehensive recommendation section outlining key areas for the client’s consideration including the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of leveraging serverless architecture to launch the product. I made a strong case as to why a cloud platform was the best choice for the client and their goal.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

The most helpful part of the process was being able to visualize the software before I started coding. This helped me identify potential problems and make sure that the design was efficient and scalable. It also helped me stay organized and avoid making mistakes.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could choose one part of my work to revise, it would be the user interface design. I think I could have made it more user-friendly and intuitive. I would also add more features, such as the ability to search for games and consoles by name or genre, and focus more deeply on security. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs by asking them questions about what they wanted the software to do. I also took into account their feedback on the design documents. I believe that it is important to consider the user's needs when designing software because it ensures that the software meets proper standards and requirements. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I approached designing software by first understanding the problem that I was trying to solve. I then gathered requirements from the user and created a design document. Once I had a design document, I started coding. I would use the same techniques and strategies in the future to analyze and design a similar software application.
